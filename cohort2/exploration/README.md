# Cohort 2 Exploration

The following sections highlight focus areas and a subset of exploratory notebooks for each.

## Wavelets

| File    | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [fft_notebook.ipynb](https://github.com/mas-dse-c6sander/DSE_Cohort2_Traffic_Capstone/blob/master/cohort2/exploration/fft_notebook.ipynb) | Discussion of Fourier transforms and application to traffic data. |
| [FFTandWavelets.ipynb](https://github.com/mas-dse-c6sander/DSE_Cohort2_Traffic_Capstone/blob/master/cohort2/exploration/FFTandWavelets.ipynb) | Initial exploration of Fourier transforms as applied to traffic flow. Brief look at wavelets (continued in the notebook below). |
| [wavelet_notebook.ipynb](https://github.com/mas-dse-c6sander/DSE_Cohort2_Traffic_Capstone/blob/master/cohort2/exploration/wavelet_notebook.ipynb) | Initial exploration into wavelets, wavelet transformation, and wavelet scale/shift. |
| [wavelets_exploration_on_wiggles2.ipynb](https://github.com/mas-dse-c6sander/DSE_Cohort2_Traffic_Capstone/blob/master/cohort2/exploration/wavelets_exploration_on_wiggles2.ipynb) | Exploration of wavelet forms and wavelet tuning as applied to the mean flow.

| [wiggles_across_multiple_years.ipynb](https://github.com/mas-dse-c6sander/DSE_Cohort2_Traffic_Capstone/blob/master/cohort2/exploration/wiggles_across_multiple_years.ipynb) | Exploration and visualization of wiggles and mean flow across multiple years. |
| [wiggle_magnitude_weekend_weekday.ipynb](https://github.com/mas-dse-c6sander/DSE_Cohort2_Traffic_Capstone/blob/master/cohort2/exploration/wiggle_magnitude_weekend_weekday.ipynb) | Analysis of weekend vs. weekday wiggle magnitudes. |
