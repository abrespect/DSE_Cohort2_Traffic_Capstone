Traffic modeling and prediction is a field that has been researched and studied for many years. With the
introduction of large data sets taken from sensor stations throughout California, and a myriad of other data sources
available contributing to traffic metrics collection, opportunities for analysis into traffic modeling and the factors
causing traffic are ever expanding.

As part of the [UCSD MAS DSE](http://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/mas/dse/) program, two consecutive cohorts of students have applied data science concepts and analysis to the traffic data.  The [Cohort 1](cohort1/) team laid the groundwork with data processing, transformation, and principal component analysis.  The findings from Cohort 1 are included in this repository as a reference.  The focus of the report outlined below is on the efforts of [Cohort 2](cohort2/).
